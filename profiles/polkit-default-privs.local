# This file is used by the set_polkit_default_privs tool to generate polkit
# rules. It is meant for local overrides of the active profile (defined in
# /etc/sysconfig/security) by the administrator of the system: any definitions
# here take precedence over the distribution defaults in
# /etc/polkit-default-privs.<profile>.

# The syntax for this file is defined in polkit-default-privs(5). Note that you
# need to run /sbin/set_polkit_default_privs for changes to take effect.
